DOCKER IMAGE THAT CONTAINS JENKINS JOB BUILDER

- This creates a docker image from specific jenkins version (2.7.1)
- This will install ansible to do a precheck on yml files base on JJB
- This will install jenkins job builder to generate the appropiate jobs

To create the image, run:
- docker build -t <image_tag> .
To start the container, run: 
- docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/tmp <image_tag>
With this command you create a volume, which mounts your local files into the /tmp folder inside the container
so any change in your localhost will be present in the container (helpful when updating yml file jobs)

Once image is created, when starting the container it is neccesary to create the following:
1. Credentials (jenkins:jenkins)
2. Install recommended plugins
3. Install custom plugins:
  # Maven Integration Plugin
  # Parameterized Trigger Plugin
  # EnvInject Plugin
  # Throttle Concurrent Builds Plugin

Execution commands:
Test: jenkins-jobs test -r globals:jobs >/dev/null
Update: jenkins-jobs update -r globals:jobs/idam/am

IN PROGRESS
- Automate the whole customization of jenkins to avoid creating user and installing plugins manually.
